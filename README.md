**
A clean and minimal dark-themed interface.

Users can add tasks by typing into an input field and clicking the "Enter" button.

Each added task is displayed as a list item with a Delete button.

Clicking "Delete" removes the corresponding task from the list.

Tasks are dynamically created and inserted into the DOM using JavaScript.

The layout is designed using Flexbox to center the content both vertically and horizontally. All styles are defined inline within the <body> tag, which simplifies structure but could be improved by moving to a <style> block or external CSS.

This app serves as a basic example of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript, making it ideal for learning how to build interactive front-end applications.
